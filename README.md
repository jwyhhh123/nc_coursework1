As discussed before, **everyone** has to complete the following functions in backprop-softmax.py:

1. forward()
2. softmax()
3. loss()
4. backward()
5. predict()
6. predict_pct()

You will need to push your own backprop-softmax.py file here. And to avoid conflicts with names of the file, please use **bs_yourname.py**
